# GitHubApiTesting
My first time doing automatic test, in this case with an external JSON of a project from another GitHub user

# Development
Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1- Install IntelliJ IDEA (that includes Maven).

2- If you prefer to run the test with command-line you can download Maven.

3- if it doesn't run the test you have to go to Maven folder and click on the option -> clean:clean and then surefire:test and it should work!

# Testing
To run the test you can run:

./mvnw clean test

Or run directly with IntelliJ IDEA
